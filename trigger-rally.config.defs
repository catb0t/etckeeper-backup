		<!-- The "copydefplayers" setting can be "yes" or "no".

		<!-- The "skipsaves" number sets how many saves are skipped

			Setting "skipsaves" to 0 will cause the game to re-save the
			player profile each time a race is successfully completed.

			Setting "skipsaves" to -1 will cause the game to only save
			the player profile at game exit.
			WARNING: if the game crashes with this setting, all player
			progress may be lost!

			Default value is 4, meaning: save at game end or at every
			fifth race finished, whichever comes first.

	<!--
		anisotropy:
			Sets the level of anisotropic filtering for textures.
			The higher the value, the higher the quality of textures.
			Its value should be a power of two, such as: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16.
			Setting it to "off" causes anisotropic filtering to be turned off.
			Setting it to "max" causes the highest supported value to be used.
			(Note that "max" may not work on some computers.)

		foliage:
			Turns vegetation on and off.
			"yes" means that bushes, grass and trees will be displayed.
			"no" means that they won't be.

		roadsigns:
			Turns road signs on and off.
			"yes" means that road signs and other sprites will be displayed.
			"no" means that they won't be.

		weather:
			Turns weather effects on and off.
			"yes" means that rain and snowfall will be displayed.
			"no" means that they won't be.

		snowflaketype:
			Chooses the kind of snowflake used in levels with snowfall.
			"point" - fast, but may not work on some computers
			"square" - failsafe option but rather ugly
			"textured" - the fancy, resource-heavy option

		dirteffect:
			Chooses whether or not to show dirt thrown by the wheels of the car.
			"yes" - enable dirt effect (may reduce framerate)
			"no" - disable dirt effect
